    "# LROSE Introductory SAMURAI Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This interactive tutorial takes you through the most basic steps of how to run SAMURAI. SAMURAI is a variational analysis technique that is described in Bell et al. (2012), Foerster et al. (2014), Foerster and Bell (2017), Cha and Bell (2021), and other publications. The SAMURAI analysis yields a maximum likelihood estimate of the atmospheric state for a given set of observations and error estimates by minimizing a variational cost function. It has more features and more development than FRACTL, and is generally recommended over the former for publication-quality analysis. The two programs together provide a powerful combination to produce high quality multi-Doppler wind fields from ground-based, airborne, or mixed configurations.\n",

    "All of the information about how SAMURAI should analyze data (e.g., paths to input data, variable names, grids, filters) is defined in parameter files for each application.

    "All data and the center file defining the Cartesian grid that SAMURAI will use need to be in the same directory. This tutorial will set up input and output directories for the initial SAMURAI exercises. *For additional SAMURAI runs, we recommend creating new input and output directories to keep all analyses separate.*\n",

    "\n",
    "The .cen file will be generated by the user through the provided Perl script. SAMURAI uses the center file to define the Cartesian frame of reference for the analysis, which be either be static or moving. It can be used to time-space correct the position of radar data in a moving storm system. It also sets the temporal limits for data to be included in the analysis. The center files are named according to the following convention: YYYYMMDD.cen\n",
    "* Provided: Generate_center.pl\n",
    "\n",
    "**c. Parameter files:**\n",
    "SAMURAI's parameter file contains information about data I/O, the cartesian grid, variable names, filters, and other scientific choices. In this tutorial, the user will create their own parameter file from scratch and fill in the important parameters.\n"
