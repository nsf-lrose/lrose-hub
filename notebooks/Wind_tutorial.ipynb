    "# LROSE Wind Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This interactive tutorial takes you through the steps of how to run FRACTL and SAMURAI. FRACTL is a fast traditional solver with integrated interpolation using LROSE infrastructure, and it is able to perform both gridding and multi-Doppler synthesis for airborne radars and multiple ground-based radars. This is different than Radx2Grid which is only capable of gridding data for a single ground-based radar. FRACTL adopts techniques from older REORDER and CEDRIC software, but with some new improvements. In contrast to the older tools, in which interpolation is followed by synthesis, FRACTL does both steps together. FRACTL doesn’t require the CfRadial file with an aggregation of the sweeps, which is different than Radx2Grid. FRACTL performs a nearest neighbor interpolation of the reflectivity instead of bilinear interpolation in Radx2Grid. It combines the Doppler velocities together using the traditional 'normal' equations but with singular value decomposition of raw velocities in spherical space rather than Cramer's rule in gridded space like CEDRIC. \n",
    "\n",
    "SAMURAI is a variational analysis technique that is described in Bell et al. (2012), Foerster et al. (2014), Foerster and Bell (2017), Cha and Bell (2021), and other publications. The SAMURAI analysis yields a maximum likelihood estimate of the atmospheric state for a given set of observations and error estimates by minimizing a variational cost function. It has more features and more development than FRACTL, and is generally recommended over the former for publication-quality analysis. The two programs together provide a powerful combination to produce high quality multi-Doppler wind fields from ground-based, airborne, or mixed configurations.\n",

    "Available options are R0, R1T0, R1T1, R1T2, R2T10, R2T20, R3, and PERIODIC following Ooyama (2002). The default \"non\"- boundary condition (R0) adds a buffer set of gridpoints that are used to calculate the solution but are discarded for output. Different boundary conditions can be set on the left (L) or right (R) side of the domain for each variable and dimension. The most common option other than R0 would be R1T0 for vertical velocity (rhow = 0) at the surface and/or domain top. Periodic domains are only valid for the i and j dimension, but are available in both the XYZ and RTZ mode. Improved boundary conditions are currently in development.\n",

    "The FRACTL 'Condition Number' represents how well-posed the geometry is for a particular multi-Doppler retrieval. It is similar to the USTD and VSTD field from CEDRIC, which represent the standard deviation of the expected error in the resolved wind field based on the geometry. Since SAMURAI solves for the wind field globally using spline basis functions, it is difficult to calculate this error at each gridpoint. If a FRACTL analysis is run on the same domain, then it can be used to remove regions with poor geometry. Here, we use a value of 10 to threshold the SAMURAI analysis."
