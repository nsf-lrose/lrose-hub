    "The [Integrated Sounding System](https://www.eol.ucar.edu/observing_facilities/iss) is a suite of instruments for profiling the atmosphere from ground level. Instrumentation we operate includes wind profiling radars, scanning wind lidars, sounding systems, and more. The ISS is a requestable facility that deploys for field projects around the world.\n",

    "This tutorial uses one day's worth of lidar data from the [M2HATS](https://www.eol.ucar.edu/field_projects/m2hats) field campaign in summer of 2023. During this project, the WindCube lidar was used mainly to derive wind profiles, so it ran mainly PPI scans. There were also periodic RHI and fixed scans.\n",
    "\n",
    "The WindCube lidar produces data in netCDF format, but it's not quite CFRadial compliant. It produces one file for each scan, and identifies the scan by type (PPI, RHI, fixed, or DBS) and by scan ID, which identifies the specific parameters (azimuth or elevation, gate spacing, etc) associated with the scan. In this data, the PPI scans with scan ID 178 were designed to be used for VAD wind calculations."
